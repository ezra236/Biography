    <p>Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021.
        Trump received a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father named him president of his real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business failures in the late twentieth century, he launched successful side ventures, mostly licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiffs or defendants in more than 4,000 legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.
        Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote.[a] A special counsel investigation established that Russia had interfered in the election to favor Trump. During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the only U.S. president without prior military or government experience.Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. <span id="o"><em>I BELIEVE HE IS GREAT AND ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC LEADERS THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.</em></span><br><img src="OIP (1).jpeg" alt="THE ALPHA" width="150" height="200"></p>

    <h5> Trump Achievements:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p class="d"><strong>The move: </strong>House Republicans had tried for years to cut off subsidies that helped low-income Obamacare enrollees with the co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles that come with their health plans. In 2017, Trump finally did it through administrative means after the GOP effort to replace the law fell apart — and he immediately drew intense outcry from Democrats and policy experts who called the move “sabotage.”</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p class="d"><strong>The impact:</strong>  The health exchanges didn’t collapse, as Trump had hoped. Instead, health plans and states quickly figured out a way to claw back the federal dollars they lost: They built the costs of the subsidies into premiums for Obamacare’s benchmark “silver” policies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="d" align="left">Trump signed a law to make cruelty to animals a <strong>federol felony</strong> so that animal abusers face tougher consequences.</p>
      </li> 
      <li>
        <p class="d" align="left"><strong>Violent crime</strong> has fallen every year he’s been in office after rising during the 2 years before he was elected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="d" align="left">Under Trump’s leadership, in 2018 the U.S. surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest producer of crude oil.</p>
      </li>

      <p>To many, Trump has been the most controversial and divisive president in modern US history, but he still enjoyed a remarkably steady approval rating thanks to his staunchly loyal supporters. Even as polling repeatedly showed that most Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, his overall approval rating barely changed.
         That changed, however, in his waning days in office. The January 6 Capitol siege saw Trump's approval hit a historic low, and the former president departed the White House in disgrace. 
         Trump is running for president again in 2024, launching his campaign in mid-November. He maintains a strong following, despite his complex legacy and controversial tenure. That said, recent polling suggests that most Republicans want their party to nominate someone other than Trump in 2024, raising questions about his electability. </p>
      <br>
       <p>Behind the stock market's boom over the past four years has been the Trump administration's drive to cut corporation tax with the stated aim of creating the "trickle-down" benefits of further job creation and improved household incomes.
        Signing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in 2017, Trump cut the top rate of corporation tax from 35 percent to 21 percent in a "simplification" plan. It was expected that major firms would make new investments and boost staff wages with the capital freed up by the change.</p>
